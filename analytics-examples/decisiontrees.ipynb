However, this approach also has some limitations. \n","\n","Depending on how the train and test data were sampled, the accuracy of the model could be significantly higher or lower than the real accuracy. To help combat this, we can employ a method known as k-fold cross validation. In cross validation, the data is divided into $k$ distinct groups (typically randomly). Then, one of these groups is held out for testing and the rest of the groups are used as training data. This process is repeated until all of the groups are held out once and the results from each test are averaged. This allows us to get an even more accurate representation of how the model performs on unseen data and the performance if it were to be trained on the entire dataset.\n","\n","We can use the scikit-learn library to run the model with k-fold cross validation.

Many of these parameters are important for many different applications, but the main one to pay attention to here is the *criterion*. This is the function which the decision tree uses to decide when and where to split the data. By default scikit-learn uses the *gini* function, which is a good choice for many cases. However, there are several other choices for criterion functions which are useful in a variety of situations. For now, we'll stick with the gini function, but you may want to try out other functions on your own to compare their performance.\n","\n","Now that we have instantiated our decision tree classifier, we want to use k-fold cross validation to train and evaluate how well it is able to predict the drug choice. For classification tasks, there are many different ways to measure the performance of a model, but one of the most common is the accuracy score.\n","\n","Accuracy measures the percentage of test data that was correctly labeled. The closer the accuracy is to 1, the better the results. In this sense, it is very easy to interpret. For accuracy to be a good measure of performance, the number of points which contain each label must be approximately equal. However in this dataset, this is the case and there are approximately equal numbers of each class. So, we will use accuracy for measurement.\n","\n","Since we are using cross validation, we get $k$ accuracy scores, which we can average to get the general accuracy.

This may seem like the right thing to do at first, but in reality it leads to overfitting. Overfitting is the phenomena where a machine learning model is so specifically tuned to the data on which it was trained that the training does not generalize to new examples well. When we think about overfitting, we generally think about the Occam'z razor principle. A less complex model is favored over a more complex model.\n","\n","For decision trees, we avoid overfitting by a process known as pruning. Pruning takes the fully trained tree and remove certain branches to reduce the model complexity. Pruning can be done in two ways: pre-pruning and post-pruning. Pre-pruning happens during the training phase. It stops the tree construction process once a certain depth is reached. Post-pruning instead grows the tree fully and then removes branches which lead to the least information gain.\n","\n","To demonstrate the effect of pruning, we will look at the Iris dataset, which is a famous dataset which classifies flowers based on their physical attributes."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2ZGV_wOlCmQW","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["from sklearn.datasets import load_iris"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-qZal2-wCmQX","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["iris_data = load_iris()\n","\n","X_iris = iris_data.data\n","y_iris = iris_data.target\n","\n","target_names = iris_data.target_names\n","feature_names = iris_data.feature_names"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Emaj1BwbCmQZ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["We can build the entire decision tree and plot it to view its complexity at full growth."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"c6IPhn-JCmQZ","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["clf_iris = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=1)\n","scores = cross_val_score(clf_iris, X_iris, y_iris, cv=k_crossVal)\n","clf_iris.fit(X_iris,y_iris)\n","\n","plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))\n","plot_tree(clf_iris, feature_names=feature_names)\n","plt.show()\n","print(\"Accuracy: %0.2f (+/- %0.2f)\" % (scores.mean(), scores.std() * 2))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1Amfg3AcCmQb","colab_type":"text"},"source":["As you can see, the tree has very high accuracy but it is also very complex for just four features.
